# Optimizing-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Here, I examined basic machine learning concepts thoroughly, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent/Ascent, K Nearest Neighbors, State Vector Machine, Clustering (Hierarchical &amp; K Means), Decision Trees , and Na√Øve Bayes. 

In this project, I tried to implement these machine learning methods myself alongside applying the corresponding Sklearn functions on the same dataset and comparing the results. To my surprise, some of my implementations even achieved higher results than those of the SKlearn library. This project really helped me better understand many critical concepts in machine learning, and made me more familiar with linear algebra and vectorization.
